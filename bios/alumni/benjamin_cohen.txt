About me:
---------
Ben graduated with a BS in CS May 2014 and started with Microsoft in the Fall as a Program Manager, working on the Windows Azure platform. While at Hopkins, in regards to CS, he researched under Prof. Scott Smith on the BigBang language (implemented integer and floating point arithmetic into the TinyBang interpreter) and CAed Intermediate Programming with Prof. Yair Amir and UI & Mobile Apps with Prof. Joanne Selinski. He is a big fan of learning new languages, especially ones with unique paradigms, and as a result had a particular love for Prof. Scott Smith's Programming Languages class. Outside of CS, he is a big comedy and theater nut, and hopes to one day do comedy writing on some professional level.
